title: 'Rooted In Sports - The Beginning...of something'

I'm not positive what Rooted In Sports is yet. In fact, I just decided on the name tonight and bought the domain. But, I do want it to become something. Or somewhere.
Ideally, somewhere people can talk about sports and what sports mean to their communities. In most major cities across America, the culture of that city is at least partially
defined by its sports teams. Boston, Chicago, Philadelphia -- all cities that are "rooted" in sports culture.

<br />

What I really want to do is visit each of these major sports cities, document my experience in each city, take pictures, interview locals, and then take all of that content and compile it
into a book. And yes, I do mean a real book with pages and everything.

<br />

This obviously would take years, and would cost a lot of time and money. But I see it as an adventure. Maybe I'm 55 when I publish the book. But if I publish it and I've visited all of the
major "sports cities", I'll be happy.

<br />

In the meantime, I hope to document the progress through this blog, while also updating an Instagram account. There may also be a podcast in the works. Because every guy in their
early to mid 30s needs to have a podcast.
